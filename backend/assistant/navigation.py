"""
Server-side checks on navigation before anything reaches the browser.

The model asks for navigate_to / guide_tour; this turns that into a real URL,
refuses places the user can't open, and fixes the most common miss - stopping
at a parent page when the user named a tab ("business defined checks" ->
/dqe with no check). The browser only ever gets a route + params that exist.
